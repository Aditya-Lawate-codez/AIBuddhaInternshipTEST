    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Here is the question</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">You are working for one of the most esteemed spy agencies in the world, one of our colleagues successfully observed our target person, Robby the hacker. We followed him to a secret warehouse, where we assumed to find all the stolen crypto tokens. The door to this warehouse is secured by an electronic combination lock. Unfortunately our spy isn&apos;t sure about the PIN he saw, when Robby entered it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The keypad has the following layout:</span></p>

<span>
    <br />
    ┌───┬───┬───┐
    <br/>
    │  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 │ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 │ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 │
  </br>
    ├───┼───┼───┤
    <br/>
    │ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 │ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 │ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 │
    <br/>
    ├───┼───┼───┤
    <br/>
    │ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 │ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 │ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 │
    <br/>
    └───┼───┼───┘
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 │
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; └───┘
    

    <br />

<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">He noted the PIN 1875, but he also said, it is possible that each of the digits he saw could actually be another adjacent digit (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally). E.g. instead of the 5 it could also be the 2, 4, 6 or 8. And instead of the 1 it could also be the 2 or 4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">He also mentioned, he knows this kind of lock. You can enter an unlimited amount of wrong PINs, they never finally lock the system or sound the alarm. That&apos;s why we can try out all possible (*) variations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">* possible in sense of: the observed PIN itself and all variations considering the adjacent digits</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Can you help us to find all those variations? It would be nice to have a function that returns an array of all variations for an observed PIN with a length of 1 to 8 digits. We could name the function getPINs.. But please note that all PINs, the observed one and also the results, must be strings, because of potentially leading &apos;0&apos;s.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">Good luck, we are counting on you to nab this hacker!</span></p>
